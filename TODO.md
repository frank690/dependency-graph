## Things to do
- [ ] handle local imports like "from . import something.else"
- [x] configure to be usable as pre-commit hook
- [ ] remove docstrings with triple single quote (''') from read lines
- [ ] make it possible to see external repositories (in detail or as a single node)
- [ ] grant more flexibility to user (e.g. edge sizes, arrow sizes, ...)
- [ ] use AST instead of regex to indentify imports. see https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#imports
- [x] introduced possibility of excluding certain (sub)folders (and their files) from analysis.
- [ ] add option to inverse output color (having a dark graph)
- [ ] group multiple modules into one package by drawing a square/something around them.
- [ ] give init files another symbol
